<br>  
  All the files are required.  <br>
  The default repository format for 3D files is STEP (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303"> ISO 10303</a> ) due to its high fidelity.  { STL files are surface geometry as opposed to solid model representations, often containing export processing artifacts }. 
<br>  

<br>

<br>  
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.freecad.org/" > FreeCAD </a> may prove suitable for viewing, handling and, if desired modifying STEP files.

## Use Case
This model is intended to enable space claim assesment in design of PCB's

  
## Consderations
The 3D model makes no accomodation for manufacturing tolerances, process or material - see Notes below.  
The assembly of the case has been tested.  

The original case also included an adhesive backed foam cut out that was compressed when the case inserted into position into the top slot.
